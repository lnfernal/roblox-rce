# Obviously obfuscated due to skids and pasters out there, so have fun trying to deobfuscate it since I'm using my own custom obfuscator!

# Requirements
A brain

A little coding knowledge

A computer running windows operating system (or mac os/linux but you will need a little more coding knowledge if so)

# Instructions
Download NodeJS from nodejs.org

Open cmd, also known as command prompt

Go to the directory where you downloaded the main.js using ```cd FolderName```

Run ```npm init -y```

And then ```npm install http```

Forgot to mention  ```npm install base-64```

Plus type ```node main.js``` for it to start

The 0day will be accessable via localhost:3000
